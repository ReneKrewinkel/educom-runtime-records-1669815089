        "Everyone has their own imagination about outer space, and each one us gets to daydream about what exactly floats or exists there. ‘Fortune Goodies’ is Minami Deutsch’s long-awaited 3rd studio album and an encyclopaedia of Krautrock, as band leader Kyotaro Miula describes it. While not all the songs on the record function as straightforward Krautrock this time around, they still manage to capture the spirit and heart of the genre. ",

        "For III, the band wanted to expand their sound while building an atmosphere with mainly monochords and reiteration. After recording and mixing the album on their own at their studio at BYM Records, they partnered with German electronic maestro Atom TM to flesh out the album’s synth parts. Most of the sounds he provided were atonal electronic sounds, aiming for concrete frequencies and sampled organic glitches. (The Korg synthesizer Atom TM plays on this record was used by Kraftwerk on tour in the '80s.)",

They go from soft to full-blown hurricane in the blink of an eye and the way they speed up and slow down will remind you of being stuck in a traffic jam. Blast cuts like opener ‘Gargamel’ and the headbutt that is ‘Drunk’n Caravan’ loud enough though and you will find they are a great way to get rid off all that pent up frustration.",

Now add brilliant minimalist post-punk guitars, crazy time signatures and another load of anger. Welcome to Shellac !",
